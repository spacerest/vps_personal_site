This post doesn't have a real theme besides what it means to me - minor setbacks and feelings of discouragement paired with some plans for the near future. 

I set up some macros at the beginning of the month to make weekly posting more possible, and they need some reworking. The purpose of the macros so far is twofold:

- take screenshots, name them appropriately, and save them automatically to a directory the corresponds to a weekly post

- copy-paste useful quotes and their corresponding URLs to the weekly post

The problem with this approach so far is that my studies over the course of the week don't naturally follow a particular route. I routinely find new things that stump me, and it's easy to get off track looking into them. 

The solution is to not constrain new information to the time that I found it out (weekly) but to start keeping track of the common themes I find myself investigating. I'll still shoot for regular posts, but the content of the posts needs to follow theme and not time. 

Below are the scattered links and pictures I've accumulated over the past couple of weeks. Like you can see, the content and the titles / themes of the posts don't match. I'll rework the logic behind this macro to make it usable over the course of this week.

####Some other goals for this week:
- learn some basic PHP

- work on a tiny game I mapped out last spring. In PHP or Ruby?

- work on a js webcrawler

[A read–eval–print loop (REPL), also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
