Setting up commenting
=====================

Hey. This is a short post to timestamp that I put commenting capability on this site. Based on my limited research, the free-est and easiest blog comment hosting service looks to be Disqus. Since hearing about Disqus, I seem to see it on all the blogs I frequent. That being said, Gary Korisko wrote an informed anti-Disqus article [Is Disqus Killing Your Blog?](http://rebootauthentic.com/disqus-comments-pull-plug/){: target="_blank"}. For the time being, I'm mostly just talking to myself on here, so the points he brings up (mainly, that commenting services should prioritize accessibility for users over ease of use for implementer) will be addressed by future me. Should she look into Facebook comments or WordPress? Only time will tell.  

To set up Disqus here, I followed the steps listed on Ankur Gupta's [Adding Disqus To Your Jekyll](http://www.perfectlyrandom.org/2014/06/29/adding-disqus-to-your-jekyll-powered-github-pages/){: target="_blank"} and didn't run into any major issues. The only small hiccup I had was in being consistent with the disqus_shortname variable both when setting up my <code>comments.html</code> file and registering this site with the Disqus mainframe. Motherboard. Headquarters.
